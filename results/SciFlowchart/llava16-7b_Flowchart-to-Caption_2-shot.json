        "reference": "Fig. 2. Overview of the proposed Structural Prior guided Generative Adversarial Transformers (SPGAT). The SPGAT contains one generator, two discriminators, and one structural prior estimator. The generator is used to explore non-local information with the guidance of a structural prior estimator (SPE) for better clear image restoration. We build the skip connections between the generator and discriminators so that the discriminators can better discriminate between real and fake features in the generator for generating more natural images. Meanwhile, SPE is also utilized to guide the discriminators for better estimations. The generator takes a low-light image L as the input and outputs an enhanced image E\u0302. The SPE is input the corresponding structure S of L by gradient operation and outputs the estimated structural prior P\u0302. Both the two discriminators take the concatenation of the enhanced image E\u0302 and estimated structural P\u0302 as the input, which is regarded as the fake label. However, there is no real label feature. To that aim, we generate real label features by inputting the normal-light image to the generator and its corresponding structure to SPE. PW-STB illustrated in Fig. 3 is the basic block of the generator, discriminators, and SPE."

Finally, the relative improvement in sharpness between the input and output magnitude images is measured and weights are backpropagated to minimize this quantity (recall minimization of this term equates to maximisation of relative image sharpness, see Eq 8).

The figure shows an example of the magnitude of the Fourier transform of a typical CTF, illustrating that the CTF typically zeros out several frequency components of the projection data. While this can pose challenges for typical pre-process and reconstruct approaches, we use this model in order to perform the reconstruction."

Then the two types of high-dimensional features are concatenated to regress unified and sorted interpolation weights (i.e., the weight learning module), which coarsely interpolate the input sparse point cloud into a dense one. The coarse point cloud is finally refined via a self-attention-based refinement module, which regresses an offset for each point from the corresponding feature (see Fig. 4 for the detailed network architecture).

        "reference": "Figure 3: PCNet \u03c0\u0302 architecture and training. PCNet approximates the real project-and-capture process \u03c0 using a deep neural network (WarpingNet + ShadingNet). The inputs are a projector input image x, a camera-captured scene image (under normal light) Is, and a projector direct light mask Im. The output I\u0302x is an inferred camera-captured scene (under superimposed projection). WarpingNet consists of a learnable affine matrix \u03b8aff, thin-plate-spline (TPS) parameters \u03b8TPS and a grid refinement networkW\u03b8r . This coarse-to-fine pipeline allows WarpingNet to learn a fine-grained image sampling grid \u2126 to warp the projector input image x to the camera\u2019s canonical frontal view by \u03c6(x,\u2126), where \u03c6(\u00b7; \u00b7) is a differentiable image interpolator [16] denoted as \u2297. Then, we use the input projector direct light mask Im to exclude occluded pixels by \u03c6(x,\u2126) Im, where is element-wise multiplication. Afterwards, this warped projector image is further used to compute an intermediate rough shading image \u03c6(x,\u2126) Im Is to enforce the occlusion constraint. ShadingNet has a two-branch encoder-decoder structure to capture complex photometric transformations. In particular, it concatenates Is and \u03c6(x,\u2126) Im Is and feeds them to the middle encoder branch. Similarly, \u03c6(x,\u2126) Im is fed to the backbone encoder branch. The skip connections between the two branches model photometric interactions between the three inputs at different levels. In addition, we pass Is to the output layer through three convolutional layers. Finally, the feature maps are fused into one inferred camera-captured scene (under superimposed projection) I\u0302x by the backbone decoder."

A human annotator draws a box on the first frame of the video; then our guiding frame selection mechanism predicts the next frame to annotate and the process iterates. Our method automatically and accurately interpolates bounding boxes for all frames that were not directly annotated by the human. Hence, at the end of the process object annotations are generated for all frames."

        "prediction": "The image you've provided appears to be a flowchart or diagram related to a machine learning or natural language processing (NLP) model. The diagram is divided into two main parts:\n\n1. **Pretraining BERT**: This section shows the architecture of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) in pretraining. It illustrates how the model is trained on a large corpus of text data. The input sequence is processed through a series of transformations, including masking out certain tokens (like '[MASK]' for 'speak' and 'that') and feeding them into a feedforward neural network (FNN). The output of the FNN is then used to predict the next sentence in the sequence.\n\n2. **Concat.**: This part of the diagram shows how the output of the FNN is concatenated with the original input sequence.\n\n3. **Loss/Metrics**: This section indicates that the model is trained using a loss function and metrics to evaluate its performance. The specific loss function and metrics are not labeled in the image.\n\nThe arrows indicate the flow of data and the operations performed on the data. The diagram is quite complex and would require a detailed understanding of the specific model and the context in which it is being used to fully interpret.",
