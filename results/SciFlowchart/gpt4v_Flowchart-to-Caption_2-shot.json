It consists of several components: a Core Generator that creates an initial low-resolution image sample, a Resolution Enhancer that transforms a low-resolution image to a higher resolution, and a Quality Booster that further refines the image quality.\n\nThe process starts with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and uses an Inverse Sample Quality Score Learning (SSL) to generate a low-resolution sample. This sample goes through the Core Generator made of a deconvolution process (DC). The output is then enhanced in resolution by the Resolution Enhancer G16, which is followed by a second Resolution Enhancer Q16.\n\nThe enhanced image then passes through a Quality Booster G32, followed by another Quality Booster Q16, to further refine the quality of the image. Each enhancement step includes a Supervised Sample Learning (SSL) process which involves classifying, computing edge mask, sampling, labeling, and a DC-GMM to improve the quality iteratively.\n\nAdditionally, the diagram shows masked image computation and the application of an edge mask enhanced residue to obtain the boosted enhanced image. The overall framework includes a loop to repeat enhancing each cropped image. A side process classifies the input image quality, which feeds into the Resolution Enhancer loop. There's also a Quality Booster enhanced image used to classify the output image quality.",
